Markowitz Portfolio Optimization and Risk Analysis is a financial modeling project that optimizes a portfolio of stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG) using Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory. It analyzes historical data from 2015 to 2023, downloaded via yfinance, to compute the efficient frontier and maximize the Sharpe ratio. The project also implements Black-Scholes option pricing, calculates Greeks (delta, gamma), and performs delta hedging to manage option risk. Additionally, it calculates historical Value at Risk (VaR) and conducts a stress test simulating a 20% market drop.
Built with Python, SciPy for optimization, NumPy for calculations, and Matplotlib for visualizations, the project includes monthly portfolio rebalancing and VaR backtesting. Key outputs include the efficient frontier, optimal portfolio weights, and risk metrics, providing insights into portfolio performance and risk management.
This project demonstrates advanced financial modeling techniques for portfolio optimization and derivatives pricing.
