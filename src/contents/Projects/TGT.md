TGT – Tunisian Got Talent is a unique social networking platform where users can showcase their talents across various domains—music, art, sports, and more. It enables direct interaction between creators and talent-seekers, encouraging recognition and opportunities.


The platform features a built-in personal assistant that helps users navigate, suggest content, and enhance interaction—offering a smart, engaging experience , this was built by me . Technologies used include Symfony for the backend, Bootstrap for the frontend, Java and JavaScript for core logic, and Codename One for mobile deployment.

TGT was selected to participate in a international hackathon by our school, recognizing its innovative concept and the potential social impact of democratizing talent discovery through technology.
