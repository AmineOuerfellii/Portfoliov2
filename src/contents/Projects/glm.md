This Jupyter Notebook project enhances traditional chain ladder reserving techniques by integrating bootstrap methods, Generalized Linear Models (GLM), and Neural Networks for insurance loss reserving. Built in Python, it uses Pandas for data handling, Statsmodels for GLM implementation, and TensorFlow for neural network modeling. The bootstrap approach generates uncertainty distributions around reserve estimates, while GLMs account for covariates like policy type. Neural networks predict loss development patterns for complex datasets. Visualizations, created with Plotly, display reserve variability and model performance. The project includes a modular structure for easy adaptation to different datasets and is designed for actuaries seeking robust reserve forecasts.
