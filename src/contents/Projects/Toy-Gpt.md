Toy GPT Transformer Model is a machine learning project implementing a simplified GPT-like transformer for natural language processing. Built with PyTorch, it features key components of the GPT architecture, including multi-head self-attention, positional encoding, feed-forward networks, and layer normalization. The model processes sequences with a causal mask for autoregressive generation, using a vocabulary embedding and a decoder-only structure with multiple layers.
The implementation includes modular classes for PositionalEncoding, MultiHeadAttention, FeedForwardNetwork, DecoderLayer, and GPTBlock, demonstrating core transformer concepts. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding transformer-based models and their application in NLP tasks.
