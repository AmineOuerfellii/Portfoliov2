CAPM and OLS is a Jupyter Notebook project that applies the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to analyze asset returns. Written in Python, it uses Pandas for data handling, Statsmodels for OLS regression, and yfinance to fetch historical stock and market data. The notebook calculates asset betas, expected returns under CAPM, and evaluates model fit with R-squared metrics. Visualizations with Matplotlib display return distributions and regression lines. The project includes data preprocessing to align time-series data and handles missing values. It is designed for financial analysts studying portfolio performance and market risk.
