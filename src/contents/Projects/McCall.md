McCall Job Search Model is an economic modeling project that implements the McCall job search model to determine the reservation wage—the minimum wage a worker accepts to stop searching for jobs. Built with Python, it uses NumPy for numerical computations, SciPy for probability distributions, and Matplotlib for visualizations. The model employs value function iteration to compute the reservation wage, considering wage offers drawn from a normal distribution and parameters like search cost (c) and discount factor (β).
Key features include plotting the wage distribution, value function iterations, and a contour plot showing how the reservation wage varies with c and β. This project provides insights into labor economics and dynamic programming for decision-making under uncertainty.
