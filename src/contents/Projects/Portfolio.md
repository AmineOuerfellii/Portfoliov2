This portfolio website serves as a central hub to present my engineering background, featured projects, and interests in research and technology. It is built using **Vite** for fast development, **React** for component-based architecture, and **Tailwind CSS** for efficient styling. 

To better understand audience behavior and engagement, I integrated **Google Analytics**, helping me improve both content and usability. The site is fully responsive and optimized for performance.
