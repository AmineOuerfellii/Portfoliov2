**Monte de Piété** is a microfinance application designed to simplify and decentralize lending. The platform matches borrowers in need of small loans with individual lenders, offering transparency and trust through a managed digital system. Users can request loans, set terms, approve/reject offers, and track repayments—all within the app.

Built with **Spring Boot** for backend services, **JavaFX** for the desktop UI, **SQL** for persistent storage, and **Postman** for API testing and validation. The project simulates real-world lending workflows and demonstrates principles of responsible microfinance.

This project was part of a larger team effort focused on promoting financial inclusion through accessible technology.
