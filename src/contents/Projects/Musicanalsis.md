Spotify 2023 Mood-Based Recommendation System is a data science project analyzing Spotify's top songs of 2023 to enhance music recommendations by incorporating user mood. The project leverages a dataset of 953 songs with audio features (e.g., danceability, valence, energy) and popularity metrics. Using SVM and KNN models, it predicts song clusters (via Kmeans) and mood labels, with cluster information improving mood prediction accuracy (SVM: 0.93 to 0.94, KNN: 0.87 to 0.91).

Built with Python, the project employs Kmeans for clustering, SVM and KNN for classification, and Russell's circumplex model for mood classification. Key steps include handling missing data, feature engineering, and correlation analysis, revealing insights into cross-platform popularity and temporal music trends.

This project demonstrates advanced machine learning techniques for personalized music recommendations, contributing to the evolution of mood-based recommendation systems.
